# Troubleshooting Guide Creation Plan

## Task Overview
Create comprehensive troubleshooting and FAQ documentation for the A-Cube SDK covering common issues, debugging techniques, and operational support.

## Analysis of Codebase Architecture

Based on the codebase analysis, the SDK has the following key components:

### Core Architecture
- **ACube SDK Core**: Event-driven architecture with lazy-loaded resources
- **Resource Layer**: OpenAPI-generated resource classes with type safety
- **HTTP Client Stack**: Enterprise-grade with circuit breaker and retry patterns
- **Error Hierarchy**: Comprehensive error types with audit information
- **Offline System**: Complex multi-tier storage with IndexedDB/AsyncStorage
- **Queue Management**: Enterprise queue with priority, batching, and retry logic
- **React Integration**: Hooks with caching, optimistic updates, and offline support

### Key Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Complex Offline Architecture**: Multi-adapter storage with encryption
2. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: State management and recovery
3. **Queue System**: Priority queuing with conflict resolution
4. **Sync Coordination**: Real-time sync with conflict detection
5. **React Hook State**: Complex offline/online state transitions
6. **Enterprise Error Handling**: Comprehensive error hierarchy with audit trails

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Create docs/troubleshooting directory structure

### Task 2: Write comprehensive troubleshooting content
- [x] Troubleshooting Overview
- [x] SDK Initialization Issues
- [x] Offline/Sync Problems  
- [x] React Integration Issues
- [x] Network and API Issues
- [x] Performance Troubleshooting
- [x] Production Issues
- [x] Migration Guide

### Task 3: Include diagnostic code examples
- [x] Debug utilities and diagnostic scripts
- [x] Common error message reference
- [x] Step-by-step resolution procedures
- [x] Performance monitoring examples

### Task 4: Create migration section
- [x] Version upgrade procedures
- [x] Breaking change documentation
- [x] Compatibility guides

## Technical Requirements

**Target Word Count**: 3000+ words for comprehensive coverage
**File Location**: `docs/troubleshooting/guide.md`
**Writing Style**: Problem-solution focused with clear step-by-step instructions
**Code Examples**: Include diagnostic scripts and debugging techniques

## Key Areas to Cover

1. **SDK Initialization**: Configuration validation, authentication setup
2. **Offline System**: Storage adapter issues, encryption problems, sync conflicts
3. **Queue Management**: Priority queue debugging, retry logic issues
4. **Circuit Breaker**: State transitions, recovery procedures
5. **React Hooks**: State management, provider setup, cache issues
6. **Performance**: Memory leaks, slow operations, optimization techniques
7. **Production**: Deployment issues, monitoring, incident response

## Error Types to Document

Based on the error hierarchy:
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues, timeouts
- `AuthenticationError`: Token problems, credential issues
- `ValidationError`: Schema validation failures
- `FiscalError`: Italian tax compliance issues
- `RateLimitError`: API throttling
- `CircuitBreakerError`: Service degradation
- `ConfigurationError`: Setup problems

## Success Criteria

- [x] Comprehensive coverage of all major SDK components
- [x] Clear diagnostic procedures for each error type
- [x] Step-by-step resolution guides
- [x] Code examples for debugging and monitoring
- [x] Production-ready incident response procedures
- [x] Migration guidance for version upgrades
