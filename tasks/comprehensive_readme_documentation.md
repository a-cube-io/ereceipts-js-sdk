# Create Comprehensive README.md for A-Cube E-Receipt SDK

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified an enterprise-grade TypeScript SDK with the following key capabilities:

### Current Architecture Analysis
- **Core SDK**: Stripe-style resource architecture with lazy loading
- **Resource Layer**: OpenAPI-generated resources (cashiers, receipts, merchants, etc.)
- **Offline System**: Complete offline-first architecture with sync engine
- **React Integration**: Full Provider pattern with hooks and error boundaries
- **Storage Layer**: Cross-platform unified storage with encryption
- **Queue Management**: Enterprise queue with retry, batching, and conflict resolution
- **HTTP Client**: Enterprise-grade client with circuit breaker, middleware stack
- **Performance**: Comprehensive optimization and analytics systems

### Key Features to Highlight
1. **Offline-first architecture** - Complete sync system with 8 major components
2. **Italian tax compliance** - Full fiscal system integration
3. **Enterprise performance** - Performance optimizer and analytics monitoring
4. **React/React Native support** - Provider pattern with comprehensive hooks
5. **Cross-platform storage** - Unified storage with encryption and platform detection
6. **Real-time sync** - Conflict resolution and progressive sync engine
7. **CLI toolkit** - Development tools and webhook utilities

## Technical Considerations

### SDK Capabilities to Document
- **Core SDK**: ACubeSDK class with lazy-loaded resources
- **Resources**: cashiers, receipts, pointOfSales, merchants, pems, cashRegisters
- **Offline System**: UnifiedStorage, EnterpriseQueueManager, ProgressiveSyncEngine
- **React Integration**: ACubeProvider, useACube*, comprehensive hook system
- **Storage Adapters**: IndexedDB, LocalStorage, React Native, File System
- **Performance**: Circuit breaker, retry logic, middleware stack
- **Security**: Encryption, access control, compliance features

### Target Audience Considerations
- **Primary**: Enterprise development teams building POS/retail solutions
- **Secondary**: Frontend developers integrating Italian tax compliance
- **Tertiary**: Individual developers exploring e-receipt solutions

### Style Guidelines
- Professional but approachable tone
- Clear, concise explanations with practical examples
- Progressive disclosure from simple to complex
- Visual hierarchy with proper markdown structure
- Code examples that work out of the box

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with hero section** - Clear value proposition and key benefits
2. **Quick start guide** - Get developers running in <5 minutes
3. **Feature showcase** - Comprehensive capability overview
4. **Practical examples** - Real-world usage patterns
5. **Architecture explanation** - System design and relationships
6. **Reference links** - Point to detailed documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear value proposition for enterprise developers
- [ ] 5-minute quick start guide that works
- [ ] Comprehensive feature overview with examples
- [ ] Professional documentation that reflects enterprise capabilities
- [ ] Proper markdown structure with visual hierarchy
- [ ] Links to comprehensive guides and API reference

## Next Steps

1. Wait for plan approval
