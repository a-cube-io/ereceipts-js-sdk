# Integration Documentation Task

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration guides for the A-Cube e-receipt SDK to help developers quickly get started and implement enterprise-grade e-receipt systems.

## Analysis Summary
Based on codebase analysis:

**Key Architecture Components:**
- Enterprise SDK with Stripe-style resource architecture
- Main `ACubeSDK` class with lazy-loaded resources (cashiers, receipts, merchants, etc.)
- Dual HTTP clients (API + Auth) with middleware stack
- Cross-platform compatibility with environment management
- Advanced offline capabilities with progressive sync
- React hooks for query/mutation/subscription patterns
- OpenAPI-first design with generated types

**Critical Features to Document:**
- Environment configuration (sandbox/production/development)
- Authentication and API key management  
- Offline-first architecture with sync capabilities
- Resource-based API structure
- React integration patterns
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance optimization for different platforms

## Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Create Getting Started Guide
- [x] Install comprehensive getting started documentation
- [x] Cover installation, basic setup, first API calls
- [x] Include environment configuration and troubleshooting
- [x] Provide progressive learning path from basic to advanced
- [x] Complete with working examples and validation steps

### ✅ Task 2: Create React Integration Guide  
- [x] Document ACubeProvider setup and configuration
- [x] Cover all React hooks (useACubeQuery, useACubeMutation, etc.)
- [x] Include offline state management patterns
- [x] Show real-time updates and optimistic UI patterns
- [x] Provide best practices and common patterns
- [x] Include advanced patterns and testing strategies

### ✅ Task 3: Create React Native Setup Guide
- [x] Document platform-specific configuration
- [x] Cover AsyncStorage integration
- [x] Include mobile-specific considerations
- [x] Address performance optimization for mobile
- [x] Provide troubleshooting for React Native specifics
- [x] Include production checklist and security considerations

## Implementation Strategy

Each guide will follow this structure:
1. **Quick Start** - Get running in 5 minutes
2. **Core Concepts** - Essential understanding
3. **Progressive Examples** - From basic to advanced
4. **Best Practices** - Enterprise patterns
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Advanced Topics** - Performance, security, customization

## Quality Standards
- All examples must be working TypeScript code
- Progressive complexity with validation steps
- Cross-platform compatibility notes
- Enterprise security considerations
- Performance optimization guidance
- Clear error handling patterns

## Completion Criteria
- [x] All three guides created with complete examples
- [x] Cross-references between guides established
- [x] Code examples tested and validated
- [x] Best practices documented with rationale
- [x] Troubleshooting sections comprehensive
