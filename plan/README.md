# 🚀 A-Cube SDK Enterprise Transformation Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project transforms the A-Cube E-Receipt SDK from a functional implementation to an enterprise-grade SDK that rivals Stripe for developer experience and technical excellence.

**Repository**: `@a-cube-io/ereceipts-js-sdk`  
**Vision**: Zero backward compatibility = Zero limitations  
**Timeline**: 15-20 weeks  
**Team**: Claude Code (Senior SDK Architect)

## 🎯 Transformation Goals

- **Resource-Based Architecture**: Stripe-style API organization
- **Enterprise Security**: End-to-end encryption, audit trails, compliance
- **Modern Developer Experience**: CLI tools, interactive docs, advanced hooks
- **Plugin-First Design**: Extensible architecture from day one
- **Extreme Performance**: <50KB bundle, tree-shaking, micro-packages
- **Quality Excellence**: >98% test coverage, zero vulnerabilities
