## DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Task 1.1: Extend BaseOpenAPIResource with Offline Capabilities

**Objective**: Add comprehensive offline support to the base resource class that all other resources inherit from.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Add offline caching for all read operations using the unified storage layer
- Implement optimistic updates with rollback capabilities
- Integrate with the EnterpriseQueueManager for operation queuing
- Add conflict resolution hooks that resources can override
- Maintain full type safety throughout offline operations

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add offline configuration interface to BaseResourceConfig
2. Add caching methods for read operations (list, retrieve, getDetails)
3. Add optimistic update methods for write operations (create, update, delete)
4. Add queue integration for offline operation management
5. Add conflict resolution framework with pluggable strategies
6. Add offline status tracking and synchronization methods

**Key Interfaces to Add**:
```typescript
interface OfflineConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  cacheStrategy: 'memory' | 'storage' | 'hybrid';
  conflictResolution: 'client-wins' | 'server-wins' | 'merge' | 'prompt';
  optimisticUpdates: boolean;
  maxCacheAge: number;
  syncOnReconnect: boolean;
}

interface OptimisticOperation {
  id: string;
  operation: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  originalData?: any;
  newData: any;
  timestamp: number;
  rollback: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Task 1.2: Implement Optimistic Update Patterns

**Objective**: Enable immediate UI updates for offline operations with intelligent rollback on failure.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Immediate UI updates for all write operations
- Automatic rollback if operation fails during sync
- Visual indicators for optimistic vs confirmed data
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Data consistency validation

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create optimistic operation tracking system
2. Add UI state markers for optimistic data
3. Implement rollback mechanisms for each operation type
4. Add conflict detection algorithms
5. Create user-friendly conflict resolution interfaces

### Task 1.3: Queue Integration

**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate all resource operations with the enterprise queue management system.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Automatic queue enrollment for offline operations
- Resource-specific queue processors
- Batch operation support for efficiency
- Priority management based on operation type
- Dependency resolution between operations

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Register queue processors for each resource type
2. Add operation prioritization logic
3. Implement batch processing for similar operations
4. Add dependency tracking between related operations
5. Create monitoring and analytics for queue performance

### Task 2.1-2.6: Individual Resource Enhancement

For each resource (Receipts, Cashiers, Merchants, PointOfSales, CashRegisters, PEMs):

**Objective**: Provide complete offline functionality specific to each business domain.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Complete CRUD operation support offline
- Resource-specific conflict resolution
- Business logic validation during offline operations
- Integration with existing validation rules
- Performance optimization for resource-specific patterns

**Common Implementation Pattern**:
1. Add missing CRUD methods (update, delete where absent)
2. Implement offline caching with resource-specific strategies
3. Add optimistic updates for all write operations
4. Create resource-specific conflict resolution
5. Integrate with queue system for operation management
6. Add offline validation that matches online validation

**Resource-Specific Considerations**:

**ReceiptsResource**:
- Large data volumes require efficient caching strategies
- Complex validation rules must work offline
- VAT calculations and fiscal compliance during offline operations
- Receipt sequencing and numbering consistency

**CashiersResource**:
- User authentication and permission management offline
- Role-based access control during offline operations
- Profile updates and synchronization

**MerchantsResource**:
- Business entity data consistency
- Configuration changes propagation
- Multi-tenant data isolation

**PointOfSalesResource & CashRegistersResource**:
- Device management and configuration
- Hardware integration during offline operations
- Device status synchronization

**PEMsResource**:
- Electronic device compliance
- Certificate management during offline operations
- Regulatory compliance validation

### Task 3.1-3.5: Enterprise Features

**Advanced Capabilities**:
- Progressive synchronization with bandwidth optimization
- Advanced conflict resolution with merge strategies
- Cross-resource operation dependencies
- Enterprise monitoring and analytics
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Phase 1 Complete When**:
✅ BaseOpenAPIResource supports offline operations
✅ Optimistic updates work seamlessly across all resources
✅ Queue integration provides reliable operation management
✅ Basic conflict resolution handles common scenarios

- Ensure offline data structures match online equivalents

**Performance**:
- Efficient caching strategies to minimize memory usage
- Batch operations to reduce overhead
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Background synchronization to avoid UI blocking

**Reliability**:
- Comprehensive error handling for offline scenarios
- Data corruption prevention and detection
- Recovery mechanisms for partial failures
- Audit trails for all offline operations

**Security**:
- Secure storage for sensitive offline data
- Encryption for cached data
- Authorization validation during offline operations
- Protection against data tampering
